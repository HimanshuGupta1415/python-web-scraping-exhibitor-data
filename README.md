# python-web-scraping-exhibitor-data

This project demonstrates a Python-based web scraping solution developed to extract exhibitor data from an online directory. The script automates the process of navigating multiple exhibitor pages and collecting structured information such as company name, stand number, website, email, contact details, address, and description.

The scraper is capable of handling multiple records (800+ exhibitors) and processes each entry sequentially, ensuring reliable data extraction. It also includes basic error handling for missing or unavailable data fields.

The extracted data is cleaned and structured into a usable format (CSV), making it suitable for further analysis, reporting, and dashboard creation.

This project showcases practical skills in web scraping, data collection, and transforming unstructured web data into structured datasets for business and analytical use cases.

This project is for educational purposes and uses publicly available data.

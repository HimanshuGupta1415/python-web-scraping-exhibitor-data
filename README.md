# python-web-scraping-exhibitor-data

🧩 Problem

Manually collecting exhibitor data from online directories is time-consuming and inefficient. Each exhibitor page contains valuable information such as company details, contact information, and descriptions, but extracting this data manually for hundreds of records is not scalable.

.

💡 Solution

Developed a Python-based web scraping script to automate the extraction of exhibitor data from a multi-page directory. The script navigates through individual exhibitor pages and captures structured information such as company name, stand number, website, email, contact details, address, and description. It also handles missing data and processes records sequentially.
